(defn pseudo-remainder
  "Compute the pseudo-remainder of univariate polynomials u and v.

  Fractions won't appear in the result; instead the divisor is multiplied by the
  leading coefficient of the dividend before quotient terms are generated so
  that division will not result in fractions. Only the remainder is returned,
  together with the integerizing factor needed to make this happen.

  Similar in spirit to Knuth's algorithm 4.6.1R, except we don't multiply the
  remainder through during gaps in the remainder. Since you don't know up front
  how many times the integerizing multiplication will be done, we also return
  the number d for which d * u = q * v + r.

  TODO note that `d` is the integerizing coefficient.

  generalize Euclid's algorithm for polynomials over a unique factorization
