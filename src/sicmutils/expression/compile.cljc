;; # Function Compilation
;;
;; Functions built out of generic operations can be compiled down into fast,
;; efficient functions that operate on doubles. The process is:
;;
;; 1. Pass symbols like `'x` in for all arguments. This will cause the function
;;    to return a "numerical expression", a syntax tree representing the
;;    function's body:
#_
(let [f (fn [x] (g/sqrt
                (g/+ (g/square (g/sin x))
                     (g/square (g/cos x)))))]
(= '(sqrt (+ (expt (sin x) 2) (expt (cos x) 2)))
   (x/expression-of (f 'x))))

;; 2. `g/simplify` the new function body. Sometimes this results in large
;;    simplifications:

#_
(let [f (fn [x] (g/sqrt
                (g/+ (g/square (g/sin x))
                     (g/square (g/cos x)))))]
  (= 1 (g/simplify (f 'x))))

;; 3. Apply "common subexpression elimination". Any subexpression inside the
;;    new, simplified body that appears more than once gets extracted out into a
;;    let-bound variable and calculated just once, then subbed in to the
;;    computation using the generated variable.
;;
;; 4. Wrap the new, efficient body up in `(fn [x] ,,,)` with the proper number
;;    of arguments and pass it to `eval`.
;;
;; Amazing!
;;
;; ## Implementation

;; Function compilation is potentially expensive, so allocate a cache of
;; function `f` to compiled function for use below:

;; ## Subexpression Elimination
;;
;; This section implements subexpression extraction and "elimination", the
;; process we use to avoid redundant computation inside of a simplified function
;; body.
;;
;; The goal of this process is to split some symbolic expression into:
;;
;; - a map of symbol -> redundant subexpression
;; - a new expression with each redundant subexpr replaced with its
;;   corresponding symbol.
;;
;; The invariant we want to achieve is that the new expression, rehydrated using
;; the symbol->subexpression map, should be equivalent to the old expression.
;;
;; First, we write a function to determine how often each subexpression appears.
;; Subexpressions that appear just once aren't worth extracting, but two
;; appearances is enough.

(defn- expr-frequencies
  "Returns a map from distinct subexpressions in the supplied `expr` to the
  number of times each appears.

  If `skip?` returns true given a subexpression it won't be included as a key in
  the returned map."
  [expr skip?]
  (let [children (partial filter seq?)]
    (->> (rest
          (tree-seq seq? children expr))
         (remove skip?)
         (frequencies))))

;; The next function assumes that we have the two data structures we referenced
;; earlier. We want to be careful that we only generate and bind subexpressions
;; that are actually used in the final computation.
;;
;; `discard-unferenced-syms` ensures this by removing any entry from our
;; replacement map that doesn't appear in the expression it's passed, or any
;; subexpression referenced by a symbol in the expression, etc etc.
;;
;; The algorithm is:
;;
;; - consider the intersection of all variables in the replacement map and the
;;   supplied expression, and store these into a map of "referenced" symbols.
;;
;; - Look up the corresponding subexpression for each of these symbols, and add
;;   all potential replacements from each subexpression into the "referenced"
;;   list, continuing this process recursively until all candidates are
;;   exhausted.
;;
;; - Return subset of the original `sym->expr` by removing any key not found in
;; - the accumulated "referenced" set.

(defn- discard-unreferenced-syms
  "Trims down a proposed map of `sym->expr` replacements (suitable for a let-binding,

    keyset of `sym->expr`

  And returns a subset of `sym->expr` containing only entries where the
  symbol-key is found in:

  - the original `expr`, or
  - in an expression referenced by a symbol in the original `expr`"

                          (set/intersection syms))]

;; This final function implements common subexpression extraction in
;; continuation-passing-style. Pass it a callback and it will invoke the
;; callback with the two arguments described above, and detailed below in its
;; docstring.
;;
;; The algorithm is:
;;
;; - For every subexpression that appears more than once in the supplied
;;   expression, generate a new, unique symbol.
;;
;; - Generate a new expression by replacing every subexpression in the supplied
;;   expression with a symbol using the new mapping of symbol -> subexpression.
;;
;; - Recursively keep going until there are no more common subexpressions to
;;   replace. At this point, discard all extra bindings (see
;;   `discard-unreferenced-syms` above) and call the continuation function with
;;   the /new/ slimmed expression, and a sorted-by-symbol list of binding pairs.
;;
;; These two return values satisfy the invariant we described above: the new
;; expression, rehydrated using the symbol->subexpression map, should give us
;; back the old expression.
;;
;; NOTE that the algorithm as implemented below uses a postwalk tree traversal!
;; This is important, as it forces us to consider smaller subexpressions first.
;; Consider some expression like:

#_
(+ (* (sin x) (cos x))
   (* (sin x) (cos x))
   (* (sin x) (cos x)))

;; At first pass, we have three repeated subexpressions:
;;
;; - `(sin x)`
;; - `(cos x)`
;; - `(* (sin x) (cos x))`
;;
;; Postwalk traversal guarantees that we replace the `sin` and `cos` terms
;; before the larger term that contains them both. And in fact the returned pair
;; looks like:

#_
[(+ g3 g3 g3) ([g1 (sin x)] [g2 (cos x)] [g3 (* g1 g2)])]

;; NOTE also that:
;;
;; - this is why the `:symbol-generator` below must generate symbols that sort
;;   in the order they're generated. Else, the final binding vector might put
;;   the `g3` term in the example above /before/ the smaller subexpressions it
;;   uses.
;;
;; - This algorithm justifies `discard-unreferenced-syms` above. Each pass will
;;   larger subexpressions like `'(* (sin x) (cos x))` that should never make it
;;   out, since they never appear in this form (since they contain smaller
;;   subexpressions).

;; ### SCI vs Native Compilation
;;
;; Armed with the above compiler optimization we can move on to the actual
;; compilation step.
;;
;; This library provides two compilation modes:
;;
;; - Native compilation via `eval`
;; - interpreted compilation via [SCI](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), the
;;   Small Clojure Interpreter.
;;
;; We enable SCI mode by default since this allows function compilation to work
;; in Clojure and Clojurescript.

(def ^:dynamic *mode* :sci)

(defn- native?
  "Returns true if native compilation mode is enabled, false otherwise."
  []
  (= *mode* :native))

;; Native compilation works on the JVM, and on Clojurescript if you're running
;; in a self-hosted CLJS environment. Enable this mode by wrapping your call in
;;
;; `(binding [*mode* :native] ,,,)`
;;
;; NOTE that we may remove native compilation support if it doesn't prove to be
;; a performance problem; sci with its sandboxing is a safer thing to offer in a
;; library that might get hosted for others to interact with via remote REPLs.

;; ## State Functions
;;
;; `compile.cljc` currently supports compilation of:
;;
;; - univariate functions (for use with ODEs, `definite-integral` etc)
;; - "state" functions.
;;
;; A state function is a function that takes any number of arguments and returns
;; a new function of a "structure", usually an up-or-down tuple or a Clojure
;; sequence.
;;
;; The compiled version of a state function like

#_
(fn [mass g]
  (fn [q] ,,,))

;; Has a signature like

#_
(fn [q [mass g]] ,,,)

;; IE, first the structure, then a vector of the original function's arguments.

(defn- state-argv
  "Returns the argument vector for a compiled state function, given:

  - `params`: a seq of symbols equal in count to the original state function's
