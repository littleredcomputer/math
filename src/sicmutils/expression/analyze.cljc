(ns sicmutils.expression.analyze
  "This namespace defines an API for working with 'expression analyzers' and
  the [[ICanonicalize]] protocol.

  Expression analyzers find canonical forms of inputs over limited vocabularies
  of operations. For example, a polynomial analyzer will expose operations like
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation by positive
  integers (but not division).

  An expression containing only these operations and symbols can then be
  converted to and from a polynomial canonical form, which in this example would
  have the effect of grouping like terms; a rational function backend would
  include the division operation and be capable of cancellation. Canonicalizing
  an expression with respect to an analyzer is therefore effected by a
  round-trip to and from the canonical form."

  If both inputs to the comparator are in `var-set,` or both are not, then the
  results are as core compare would return. But if one is in `var-set` and the
  other is not, then the other will always compare greater.

  In this way, expressions produced by the simplifier will have simple variables
  sorted earlier than expressions involving those variables."

  For example, in the case of polynomial canonical form, we would replace a
  subexpression like `(sin x)` with a gensym, before entry, since the sine
  operation is not available to the polynomial canonicalizer, and restore it
  afterwards."
