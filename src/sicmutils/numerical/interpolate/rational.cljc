;; ## Rational Function Interpolation
;;
;; This namespace contains implementations of rational function interpolation
;; methods. The [ALGLib](https://www.alglib.net/interpolation/rational.php) user
;; guide has a nice page on [rational function
;; interpolation](https://www.alglib.net/interpolation/rational.php), which
;; suggests that the Bulirsch-Stoer method, included here, is NOT great, and
;; that there are better methods. We'd love implementations of the others if you
;; agree!
;;
;; The main method in this package is an incremental version of the
;; Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm.
;;
;; Just like with polynomial interpolation, let's start with a straightforward
;; implementation of the non-incremental recursive algorithm.

(defn bulirsch-stoer-recursive
  "Returns the value of `P(x)`, where `P` is rational function fit (using the
  Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm, of similar style to Neville's algorithm described in
  `polynomial.cljc`) to every point in the supplied sequence `points`.

  `points`: is a sequence of pairs of the form `[x (f x)]`

  \"The Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm produces the so-called diagonal rational
  function, with the degrees of numerator and denominator equal (if m is even)
  or with the degree of the denominator larger by one if m is odd.\" ~ Press,
  Numerical Recipes, p105

  The implementation follows Equation 3.2.3 on on page 105 of Press:
  http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f3-2.pdf.

(defn bulirsch-stoer
  "Takes

  - a (potentially lazy) sequence of `points` of the form `[x (f x)]` and
  - a point `x` to interpolate

  and generates a lazy sequence of approximations of `P(x)`. Each entry in the
  return sequence incorporates one more point from `points` into the P(x)
  estimate.

  `P(x)` is rational function fit (using the Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm, of
  similar style to Neville's algorithm described in `polynomial.cljc`) to every
  point in the supplied sequence `points`.

  \"The Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm produces the so-called diagonal rational
  function, with the degrees of numerator and denominator equal (if m is even)
  or with the degree of the denominator larger by one if m is odd.\" ~ Press,
  Numerical Recipes, p105

  The implementation follows Equation 3.2.3 on on page 105 of Press:
  http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f3-2.pdf.

  ## Column

  If you supply an integer for the third (optional) `column` argument,
  `bulirsch-stoer` will return that /column/ offset the interpolation tableau
  instead of the first row. This will give you a sequence of nth-order
  polynomial approximations taken between point `i` and the next `n` points.

  As a reminder, this is the shape of the tableau:

   p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
   p1 p12 p123 p1234 .
   p2 p23 p234 .     .
   p3 p34 .    .     .
   p4 .   .    .     .

  So supplying a `column` of `1` gives a sequence of 2-point approximations
  between pairs of points; `2` gives 3-point approximations between successive
  triplets, etc.

;; ## Incremental Bulirsch-Stoer
;;
;; Press, in [Numerical Recipes section
;; 3.2](http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f3-2.pdf), describes a
;; modification to the Bulirsch-Stoer that lets you track the differences from
;; the left and left-up entries in the tableau, just like the modified Neville
;; method in `polynomial.cljc`. the algorithm is implemented below.

(defn bs-prepare
  "Processes an initial point [x (f x)] into the required state:

  [x_l, x_r, C, D]

  The recursion starts with $C = D = f(x)$."
  [[x fx]] [x x fx fx])

(defn bs-merge
  "Implements the recursion rules described in Press's Numerical Recipes, section
  3.2 http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f3-2.pdf to generate x_l, x_r, C
  and D for a tableau node, given the usual left and left-up tableau entries.

  This merge function ALSO includes a 'zero denominator fix used by Bulirsch and
  Stoer and Henon', in the words of Sussman from `rational.scm` in the scmutils
  package.

  If the denominator is 0, we pass along C from the up-left node and d from the
  previous entry in the row. Otherwise, we use the algorithm to calculate.

  TODO understand why this works, or where it helps!"

  (fn [[xl _ _ dl] [_ xr cr _]]

          d*ratio (-> (/ (- x xl)
                         (- x xr))
                      (* dl))
          den  (- d*ratio cr)]
      (if (zero? den)
        (do (log/info "zero denominator!")
            [xl xr cr dl])
        (let [cnum (* d*ratio c-d)
              dnum (* cr c-d)]
          [xl xr (/ cnum den) (/ dnum den)])))))

(defn modified-bulirsch-stoer
  "Similar to `bulirsch-stoer` (the interface is identical) but slightly more efficient.
  Internally this builds up its estimates by tracking the delta from the
  previous estimate.

  This non-obvious change lets us swap an addition in for a division,
  making the algorithm slightly more efficient.

  See the `bulirsch-stoer` docstring for usage information, and info about the
  required structure of the arguments.
