;; ## Numerical Quadrature
;;
;; This namespace unites all of the work inside `sicmutils.numerical.quadrature`
;; behind a single interface, fronted by the all-powerful `definite-integral`
;; function.
;;
;; The interface takes `f`, an integrand, along with bounds `a` and `b`:
;;
;; (definite-integral f a b)
;;
;; Optionally, you can provide a dictionary of customizing options. These are
;; passed down to whatever method you supply via the `:method` key.
;;
;; (definite-integral f a b opts)
;;
;;
;; ## Implementation
;;
;; The keys in `quad-methods` below define the full range of integration methods
;; available in the package. Each entry in this dictionary is either:
;;
;; - An 'integrator' function that matches the interface above for
;;   `definite-integral` (possibly created with `qc/defintegrator`)
;;
;; - a dictionary of extra options. This must contain a `:method` key.
;;
;; This latter style is used when the method itself is a specialization of a
;; more general method.

  may have more entries than the `m` you pass in.)

  `qi/improper` and able to handle infinite endpoints (as well as non-infinite

(defn definite-integral
  "Evaluates the definite integral of integrand `f` across the interval $a, b$.
  Optionally accepts a dictionary `opts` of customizing options; All `opts` will
  be passed through to the supplied `integrate` functions.

  If you'd like more control, or to retrieve the integration function directly
  without looking it up via `:method` each time, see `get-integrator`.

  All supplied options are passed through to the underlying integrator; see the
  specific integrator for information on what options are available.

  ## Keyword arguments:

  `:method`: Specifies the integration method used. Must be

  - a keyword naming one of the available methods in `available-methods`
  - a function with the proper integrator signature
  - a dictionary of integrator options with a `:method` key

  Defaults to `:open`, which specifies an adaptive bulirsch-stoer quadrature method.

  `:compile?` If true, the generic function will be simplified and compiled
  before execution.

  `:info?` If true, `definite-integral` will return a map of integration
  information returned by the underlying integrator. Else, returns an estimate
  of the definite integral."
