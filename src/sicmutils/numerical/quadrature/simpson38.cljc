;; ## Simpson's 3/8 Rule
;;
;; This numerical integration method is a [closed Newton-Cotes
;; formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas#Closed_Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas);
;; for each integral slice, Simpson's 3/8 rule samples each endpoint and TWO
;; interior, equally spaced points, and combines them into an area estimate for
;; this slice using the following formula:
;;
;; $${{3h} \over 8} (f_0 + 3f_1 + 3f_2 + f_3)$$
;;
;; Given a window of $[a, b]$ and a "step size" of $h = {{b - a} \over 3}$. The
;; point $f_i$ is the point $i$ steps into the window.
;;
;; There are a few simpler ways to understand this:
;;
;; - Simpson's 3/8 rule is simply the trapezoid method (see `trapezoid.cljc`),
;;   subject to a single refinement of "Richardson extrapolation", with an
;;   threefold-increase of integration slices at each step, from $n \to 3n$.
;;
;; - The trapezoid method fits a line to each integration slice. Simpson's 3/8
;;   rule fits a cubic to each slice.
;;
;; The test namespace contains a symbolic proof that the Richardson-extrapolated
;; Trapezoid method is equivalent to using the formula above to calculate
;; Simpson's 3/8 rule directly.

(defn simpson38-sequence
  "Returns a (lazy) sequence of successively refined estimates of the integral of
  `f` over the closed interval $[a, b]$ using Simpson's 3/8 rule.

  Simpson's 3/8 rule is equivalent to the trapezoid method subject to:

  - one refinement of Richardson extrapolation, and

  - a geometric increase of integration slices by a factor of 3 for each
  sequence element. (the Trapezoid method increases by a factor of 2 by
  default.)

  The trapezoid method fits a line to each integration slice. Simpson's 3/8 rule
  fits a cubic to each slice.

  Returns estimates with $n, 3n, 9n, ...n3^i$ slices, geometrically increasing by a
  factor of 3 with each estimate.

    ## Optional arguments:

  If supplied, `:n` (default 1) specifies the initial number of slices to use.

  NOTE: the Trapezoid method is able to reuse function evaluations as its
  windows narrow /only/ when increasing the number of integration slices by 2.
  Simpson's 3/8 rule increases the number of slices geometrically by a factor of
  2 each time, so it will never hit the incremental path. You may want to
  memoize your function before calling `simpson38-sequence`."
