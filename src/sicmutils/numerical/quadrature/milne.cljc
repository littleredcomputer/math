;; ## Milne's Rule
;;
;; This numerical integration method is an [open Newton-Cotes
;; formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas#Open_Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas);
;; for each integral slice, Milne's rule samples three interior points (not the
;; endpoints!) and combines them into an area estimate for this slice using the
;; following formula:
;;
;; $${{4h} \over 3} (2f_1 - f_2 + 2f_3)$$
;;
;; Given a window of $(a, b)$ and a "step size" of $h = {{b - a} \over 3}$. The
;; point $f_i$ is the point $i$ steps into the window.
;;
;; There is a simpler way to understand this! Milne's method is, in fact, just
;; the midpoint method (see `midpoint.cljc`), subject to a single refinement
;; of "Richardson extrapolation".
;;
;; The test namespace contains a symbolic proof that the Richardson-extrapolated
;; Midpoint method is equivalent to using the formula above to calculate
;; Milne's rule directly.

(defn milne-sequence
  "Returns a (lazy) sequence of successively refined estimates of the integral of
  `f` over the open interval $(a, b)$ using [Milne's
  rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas#Open_Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas).

  Milne's rule is equivalent to the midpoint method subject to one refinement of
  Richardson extrapolation.

  Returns estimates with $n, 2n, 4n, ...$ slices, geometrically increasing by a
  factor of 2 with each estimate.

  ## Optional arguments:

  If supplied, `:n` (default 1) specifies the initial number of slices to use.

  NOTE: the Midpoint method is able to reuse function evaluations as its windows
  narrow _only_ when increasing the number of integration slices by 3. Milne's
  method increases the number of slices geometrically by a factor of 2 each
  time, so it will never hit the incremental path. You may want to memoize your
  function before calling [[milne-sequence]]."

  Optionally accepts `opts`, a dict of optional arguments. All of these get
  passed on to `us/seq-limit` to configure convergence checking.

  might apply when using this integration method and information on the optional
