  The `options` allowed differs slightly from `defmulti`:

  - the first optional argument is a docstring.

  - the second optional argument is a dict of metadata. When you query the
  defined multimethod with a keyword, it will pass that keyword along as a query
  to this metadata map. (`:arity` is always overridden if supplied, and `:name`
  defaults to the symbol `f`.)
