#+TITLE: Plan: unit system

* OBJECTIVES
** Core feature parity with scmutils
** "Do we have a nice Clojure API, or is this just copied Scheme?"
* PLAN
** DONE Symbolic representation of Units and WithUnits
This lets us see what we're doing from the REPL
** Get /SOMETHING/ hooked into sicmutils.generic/*
wat?

This would let us use generic multiplication calls.
* LOG
** 2020-12-29
*** ->symbolic progression
- [X] Change core SI Unit implementation to keep a list of base units as symbols
- [X] Hook into sicmutils symbolic computation for comparison and symbolic
  representation (as used in tests)
*** Hook Units into sicmutils.generic/*
???
