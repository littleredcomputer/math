#+TITLE: Plan: unit system

* OBJECTIVES
** Core feature parity with scmutils
- multiplication for number with units
- multiplication for symbolic expression with units
- pull in constants from scmutils
** "Do we have a nice Clojure API, or is this just copied Scheme?"
- Alternatives for ~(& 1 &meter)~ syntax?
* PLAN
** Get /SOMETHING/ hooked into sicmutils.generic/*
wat?

This would let us use generic multiplication calls. Enables writing higher level
tests, "more natural". Is this hard?
* LOG
** 2020-12-29
*** ->symbolic progression
- [X] Change core SI Unit implementation to keep a list of base units as symbols
- [X] Hook into sicmutils symbolic computation for comparison and symbolic
  representation (as used in tests)
*** Hook Units into sicmutils.generic/*
???
*** Alternatives for next step
1. Encode a constant from scmutils
2. Build compatibility with ~sicmutils.value/Value~
* ARCHIVE
** DONE Symbolic representation of Units and WithUnits
This lets us see what we're doing from the REPL
