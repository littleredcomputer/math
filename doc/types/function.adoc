= Function Generics

== Functions

In SICMUtils, functions are data just like other mathematical objects, and the
generic arithmetic system is extended to include them. If `<f>` is an expression
denoting a function, then:

[source, clojure]
----
(fn? <any>)         ;;=> <boolean>
(kind <f>)          ;;=> :sicmutils.value/function
----

Operations on functions generally construct new functions that are the
composition of the operation with its arguments, thus applying the operation to
the value of the functions: if `U` is a unary operation, if `f` is a function,
and if `x` is arguments appropriate to `f`, then:

[source, clojure]
----
((U f) x) = (U (f x))
----

If `B` is a binary operation, if `f` and `g` are functions, and if `x` is
arguments appropriate to both `f` and `g`, then:

[source, clojure]
----
((B f g) x) = (B (f x) (g x))
----

All of the usual unary operations are available. So if `<f>` is an expression
representing a function, and if `<x>` is any kind of argument for `<f>` then,
for example,

[source, clojure]
----
((negate <f>) <x>) = (negate (f <x>))
((invert <f>) <x>) = (invert (f <x>))
((sqrt <f>) <x>)   = (sqrt (f <x>))
----

The other operations that behave this way are:

[source, clojure]
----
exp, log, sin, cos, asin, acos, sinh, cosh, abs,
real-part, imag-part, magnitude, angle, conjugate, atan
----

The binary operations are similar, with the exception that mathematical objects
that may not be normally viewed as functions are coerced to constant functions
for combination with functions.

[source, clojure]
----
((+ <f> <g>) <x>) = (+ (f <x>) (g <x>))
((- <f> <g>) <x>) = (- (f <x>) (g <x>))
----

For example:

[source, clojure]
----
((+ sin 1) 'x) == (+ (sin 'x) 1)
----

The other operations that behave in this way are:

[source, clojure]
----
*, /, expt, gcd, make-rectangular, make-polar
----

TIP: All generic operations should work this way, so give them a try even if
they're not on the list.

== Literal Functions

We often need literal functions in our computations. The object produced by
`(literal-function 'f)` acts as a function of one real variable that produces a
real result. The name (expression representation) of this function is the symbol
`'f`. This literal function has a derivative, which is the literal function with
expression representation `(D f)`. Thus, we may make up and manipulate
expressions involving literal functions:

[source, clojure]
----
(freeze ((literal-function 'f) 3))
;;=>  (f 3)

(simplify ((D (* (literal-function 'f) cos)) 'a))
;;=> (+ (* ((D f) a) (cos a)) (* -1 (f a) (sin a)))

(simplify
 ((compose (D (* (literal-function 'f) cos))
           (literal-function 'g))
  'a))
;;=> (+ (* ((D f) (g a)) (cos (g a)))
        (* -1 (f (g a)) (sin (g a))))
----

We may use such a literal function anywhere that an explicit function of the
same type may be used.

=== The Literal function descriptor language

We can also specify literal functions with multiple arguments and with
structured arguments and results. For example, to denote a literal function
named `g` that takes two real arguments and returns a real value `( g:RXR -> R
)` we may write:

[source, clojure]
----
(def g (literal-function 'g (-> (X Real Real) Real)))

(print-expression (g 'x 'y))
(g x y)
----

The descriptors for literal functions look like prefix versions of the standard
function types. Thus, we write: `(literal-function 'g (-> (X Real Real) Real))`

The base types are the real numbers, designated by `Real`. We will later extend
the system to include complex numbers, designated by `Complex`.

Types can be combined in several ways. The cartesian product of types is
designated by:

[source, clojure]
----
(X <type1> <type2> ...)
----

We use this to specify an argument tuple of objects of the given types arranged
in the given order.

Similarly, we can specify an up tuple or a down tuple with:

[source, clojure]
----
(UP <type1> <type2> ...)
(DOWN <type1> <type2> ...)
----

We can also specify a uniform tuple of a number of elements of the same type
using:

[source, clojure]
----
(UP* <type> [n])
(DOWN* <type> [n])
----

So we can write specifications of more general functions:

[source, clojure]
----
(def H
  (literal-function 'H
                    (-> (UP Real (UP Real Real)
                            (DOWN Real Real))
                        Real)))

(def s (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'p_x 'p_y)))

(print-expression (H s))
;; (H (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y)))

(print-expression ((D H) s))
;; (down
;;  (((partial 0) H) (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y)))
;;  (down
;;   (((partial 1 0) H) (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y)))
;;   (((partial 1 1) H) (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y))))
;;  (up
;;   (((partial 2 0) H) (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y)))
;;   (((partial 2 1) H) (up t (up x y) (down p_x p_y)))))
