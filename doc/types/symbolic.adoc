= Symbolic Expressions

== Symbolic Expressions

All primitive mathematical procedures are extended to be generic over symbolic
arguments. When given symbolic arguments these procedures construct a symbolic
representation of the required answer. There are primitive literal numbers. We
can make a literal number that is represented as an expression by the symbol
`'a` as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(literal-number 'a)
----

The literal number is an object that has the type of a number, but its
representation as an expression is the symbol `'a`:

[source, clojure]
----
(kind (literal-number 'a))
;;=>  :sicmutils.expression/numeric

(freeze (literal-number 'a))
;;=>  a
----

Literal numbers may be manipulated, using the generic operators:

[source, clojure]
----
(sin (+ (literal-number 'a) 3))
;;=> (sin (+ 3 a))
----

To make it easy to work with literal numbers, Clojure symbols are interpreted by
the generic operations as literal numbers:

[source, clojure]
----
(sin (+ 'a 3))
;;=>  (sin (+ 3 a))
----

We can extract the numerical expression from its type-tagged representation with
the `freeze` procedure:

[source, clojure]
----
(freeze (sin (+ 'a 3)))
;;=>  (sin (+ 3 a))
----

but usually we really don't want to look at raw expressions

[source, clojure]
----
(freeze ((D cube) 'x))
;;=>  (+ (* x (+ x x)) (* x x))
----

because they are unsimplified. We will talk about simplification later, but for
now note that `simplify` will usually give a better form:

[source, clojure]
----
(simplify ((D cube) 'x))
;;=>  (* 3 (expt x 2))
----

and `print-expression`, which incorporates `simplify`, will attempt to format
the expression nicely.

Besides literal numbers, there are other literal mathematical objects, such as
vectors and matrices, that can be constructed with appropriate constructors:

[source, clojure]
----
(literal-vector <name>)
(literal-down-tuple <name>)
(literal-up-tuple <name>)
(literal-matrix <name>)
(literal-function <name>)
----

WARNING: As of version `0.14.0`, these haven't yet been ported over to Clojure
from `scmutils`. Stay tuned for a future release, as we have all of the
machinery in place to do this.

There are currently no simplifiers that can manipulate literal objects of these
types into a nice form.
