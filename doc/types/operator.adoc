== Operators

Operators are a special class of functions that manipulate functions. They
differ from other functions in that multiplication of operators is understood as
their composition, rather than the product of their values for each input. The
prototypical operator is the derivative, `D`. For an ordinary function, such as
`sin`:

[source, clojure]
----
((expt sin 2) x) == (expt (sin x) 2)
----

but derivative is treated differently:

[source, clojure]
----
((expt D 2) f) ==  (D (D f))
----

New operators can be made by combining others. So, for example, `(expt D 2)` is
an operator, as is `(+ (expt D 2) (* 2 D) 3)`.

We start with a few primitive operators, the total and partial derivatives,
which will be explained in detail later.

----
o/identity

derivative (also named D)

(partial <component-selectors>)
----

If `<O>` is an expression representing an operator then

----
(o/operator? <any>)       ;;=> <boolean>
(kind <O>)                ;;=> :sicmutils.operator/operator
----

Operators can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and scaled. If they are combined
with an object that is not an operator, the non-operator is coerced to an
operator that multiplies its input by the non-operator.

The transcendental functions `exp`, `sin`, and `cos` are extended to take
operator arguments. The resulting operators are expanded as power series.

NOTE: this works for almost all of the trigonometric functions. If an operation
is implemented for `:sicmutils.series/power-series` it will work for operators.
