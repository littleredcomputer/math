== Getting Involved / What's Missing?

Here's a short overview. More info coming soon!

=== Developing in SICMUtils

To run all tests in Clojure, you'll need the https://leiningen.org[Leiningen]
build tool. The Clojurescript tests require https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]. If
you're on a Mac, install https://brew.sh[Homebrew]:

[source, bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

Then run

[source, bash]
----
brew install leiningen node
----

To get both dependencies.

=== Clojure Tests

To run the full Clojure test suite:

[source, bash]
----
lein test
----

=== Clojurescript Tests

To run the full Clojurescript test suite:

[source, bash]
----
lein test-cljs
----

We check for advanced compilation warnings using [shadow-cljs].

In the ``sicmutils`` directory, run

[source, bash]
----
npm install
----

Then, to compile cljs and see any warnings:

[source, bash]
----
shadow-cljs watch test
----
