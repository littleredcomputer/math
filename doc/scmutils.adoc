== Comparison to scmutils

Rather than just quasi-mechanically translate the Scheme to Clojure, We've
studied the implementation of the system before bringing it to Clojure, and have
used TDD throughout the project (which turned out to be absolutely essential as
I considered various approaches to problems posed by the Scheme code base). At
this writing there are over 4200 unit tests.

Here's a side-by-side example of `scmutils` Scheme code and `SICMUtils` Clojure
code. First, the Scheme:

[source, scheme]
----
;; Scheme
(define ((L-central-polar m U) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local))
        (qdot (velocity local)))
    (let ((r (ref q 0)) (phi (ref q 1))
          (rdot (ref qdot 0)) (phidot (ref qdot 1)))
      (- (* 1/2 m
           (+ (square rdot)
              (square (* r phidot))) )
         (U r)))))
----

Then the same function in idiomatic Clojure:

[source, clojure]
----
;; Clojure
(defn L-central-polar [m U]
  (fn [[_ [r] [rdot φdot]]]
    (- (* 1/2 m
          (+ (square rdot)
             (square (* r φdot))))
       (U r))))
----

We can see a few things from this example. `L-central-polar` wants to compute a
Lagrangian for a point mass `m` in a potential field `U`. In Scheme, it's
possible to specify currying at the site of a function's definition:
`(L-central-polar m U)` returns a function of the `local` tuple (a sequence of
time, generalized coordinates, and generalized velocities). We don't have that
syntax in Clojure, but instead have something even more useful: argument
destructuring. We can pick out exactly the coordinates we want out of the local
tuple components directly.

While function definitions cannot be typed directly from the book, function
applications in Clojure and Scheme are the same. The following works in both
systems:

[source, clojure]
----
(((Lagrange-equations (L-central-polar 'm (literal-function 'U)))
  (up (literal-function 'r)
      (literal-function 'φ)))
  't)
----

yielding:

[source, clojure]
----
(down
 (+ (* -1N m (expt ((D φ) t) 2) (r t)) (* m (((expt D 2) r) t)) ((D U) (r t)))
 (+ (* 2N m ((D φ) t) (r t) ((D r) t)) (* m (expt (r t) 2) (((expt D 2) φ) t))))
----

Which, modulo a few things, is what Scmutils would give. From later in
{uri-SICM}[SICM] (pp. 81-2) we have, in Scheme:

[source, scheme]
----
(define ((T3-spherical m) state)
  (let ((t (time state))
        (q (coordinate state))
        (qdot (velocity state)))
    (let ((r (ref q 0))
          (theta (ref q 1))
          (phi (ref q 2))
          (rdot (ref qdot 0))
          (thetadot (ref qdot 1))
          (phidot (ref qdot 2)))
      (* 1/2 m
         (+ (square rdot)
            (square (* r thetadot))
            (square (* r (sin theta) phidot)))))))

(define (L3-central m Vr)
  (define (Vs state)
    (let ((r (ref (coordinate state) 0)))
      (Vr r)))
  (- (T3-spherical m) Vs))

(((partial 1) (L3-central ’m (literal-function ’V)))
  (up ’t
      (up ’r ’theta ’phi)
      (up ’rdot ’thetadot ’phidot)))
----

And in Clojure, using a couple of simplifying definitions:

[source, clojure]
----
(def V (literal-function 'V))
(def spherical-state (up 't
                         (up 'r 'θ 'φ)
                         (up 'rdot 'θdot 'φdot)))
(defn T3-spherical [m]
  (fn [[t [r θ φ] [rdot θdot φdot]]]
    (* 1/2 m (+ (square rdot)
                (square (* r θdot))
                (square (* r (sin θ) φdot))))))

(defn L3-central [m Vr]
  (let [Vs (fn [[_ [r]]] (Vr r))]
    (- (T3-spherical m) Vs)))

(((partial 1) (L3-central 'm V)) spherical-state)
----

yielding

[source, clojure]
----
(down
 (+ (* m r (expt φdot 2) (expt (sin θ) 2)) (* m r (expt θdot 2)) (* -1 ((D V) r)))
 (* m (expt r 2) (expt φdot 2) (sin θ) (cos θ))
 0)
----

Which again agrees with Scmutils modulo notation. (These results are examples of
"down tuples", or covariant vectors, since they represent derivatives of objects
in primal space.)

The partial derivative operation is called `partial` in Scmutils, but Clojure
defines `partial` to mean partial function application. In this system, we take
a page from JavaScript and replace partial with a shim which will compute
partial derivatives when all the arguments are integers and fall back to
Clojure's definition of partial otherwise. Since it doesn't make sense to
partially apply an integer, `partial` should just do the right thing.

You could render that result in TeX:

image:/doc/img/md-eq1.png[TeX result]

using the `->TeX` function. You can also use `->infix` to obtain:

----
down(m r φdot² sin²(θ) + m r θdot² - DV(r), m r² φdot² sin(θ) cos(θ), 0)
----

or even `->JavaScript` to get:

[source, javascript]
----
function(D, V, m, r, θ, θdot, φdot) {
  var _0001 = Math.sin(θ);
  var _0002 = Math.pow(φdot, 2);
  return [m * r * _0002 * Math.pow(_0001, 2) + m * r * Math.pow(θdot, 2) - (D(V)(r)), m * Math.pow(r, 2) * _0002 * _0001 * Math.cos(θ), 0];
}
----

(For rendering into code, a simple common-subexpression extraction algorithm is
used.)

=== Numerical Methods

This system uses the delightful {uri-ACM}[Apache Commons Math] library to
implement some of the numerical methods needed for the book. Many of the methods
we used to pull from Commons are now implemented in native Clojure(script); our
goal is to remove this dependency once we get a pure Clojure implementation of
the Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer ODE integrator implemented.

The Scmutils simplifier has three engines: a polynomial-based simplifier useful
for grouping like terms, a rational-function-based simplifier used for
cancellation in fractional expressions, and a rule-based simplifier to apply
identities like ``sin² x + cos² x = 1``.

I have implemented all of these, but acceptable performance from the
rational-function simplifier is waiting for an implementation of Zippel's
algorithm for fast multivariate polynomial GCD operations. Currently we use a
recursive Euclid algorithm, which gives acceptable results for expressions of
medium complexity, but there is more to be done.

== What's not there yet

=== The latter half of FDG

Most of the code in the early sections of FDG will work, but this cannot be
considered complete.

=== Quaternions, and other exotica

The Scmutils library is vast, and I don't pretend to have covered anywhere near
all of it. The breadth-first approach I have used to get the textbook examples
working has left many corners of the source library unexplored as of this
writing.
