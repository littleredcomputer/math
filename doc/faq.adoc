=== Who is using SICMUtils?

- https://github.com/kloimhardt[@kloimhardt] has integrated SICMUtils into his
  https://scratch.mit.edu[Scratch]-like, blocks-based language at
  https://github.com/kloimhardt/clj-tiles[clj-tiles]. See
  https://kloimhardt.github.io/cljtiles.html?page=freeparticle[this demo] for a
  lovely example of Lagrangian Mechanics in ``clj-tiles``.

- @light-matters and @MagusMachinae are collaborating on
  [Peek](https://gitlab.com/LightMatters/peek): "A Clojure implementation of
  symbolic quantum mechanics, or, as it could be called, measurement mechanics.
  The current name reflects my idea of one of the, if not most, distinguishing
  features of quantum mechanics: that observation changes the result."
