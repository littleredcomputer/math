- File moves!
  - `sicmutils.polynomial-gcd` => `sicmutils.polynomial.gcd`
  - `sicmutils.polynomial-factor` => `sicmutils.polynomial.factor`
  - `sicmutils.rules` => `sicmutils.simplify.rules`
  - `sicmutils.analyze` => `sicmutils.expression.analyze`

- `sicmutils.env/one?` now exposes/aliases `sicmutils.value/unity?`
  [#154](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/154)

- Fixed [#93](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/issues/93) by
  adding an explicit `g/invert` implementation for polynomials in the rational
  fn namespace. The fix lives in
  [#169](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/169).

- added `sicmutils.value/sqrt-machine-epsilon`
  ([#170](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/170))

- fixed issues in `function.cljc` and `operator.cljc` where the Clojurescript
  `IFn` `-invoke` arguments shadowed either the `this` operator, or some
  parameter name in the deftype
  ([#169](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/169))

- `g/sqrt` now maintains precision with Clojurescript's rational numbers.
  `(g/sqrt #sicm/ratio 9/4)` for example returns `#sicm/ratio 3/2`.
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- `g/determinant` and `g/transpose` now act as identity for everything in the
  numeric tower, plus symbolic expressions
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- `sicmutils.expression.Expression` is now `sicmutils.expression.Literal`; it
  has a new `meta` field, and is a `deftype` instead of a `defrecord`.
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))
  - To get the internal expression, use `x/expression-of` instead of
    `:expression`.
  - to access the `type` field, use `x/literal-type` instead of `:type`

- 2-arity `g/atan`, `g/cross-product` and `g/gcd` now work for functions
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- `Literal` now responds appropriately to `v/unity?` and `v/nullity?` if it
  wraps a numerical "0" or "1". `v/exact?` now returns true if the literal wraps
  an exact number ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- `x/variables-in` now works with wrapped expressions; no more need to
  explicitly unwrap
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- `x/walk-expression` renamed `x/evaluate`
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

- The new `x/substitute` performs substitutions on an _unwrapped_ expression
  ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168))

-  `x/compare` returns a comparator that works with unwrapped symbolic
   expression trees
   ([#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168)). The rules
   are that that types have the following ordering:
  - empty sequence is < anything (except another empty seq)
  - real < symbol < string < sequence
  - sequences compare element-by-element
  - Any types NOT in this list compare using hashes

- `g/transpose` now works properly for functions that act as linear maps. The
  defining relation is:

```clojure
(= (((transpose f) g) 'x)
   (g (f x)))
```

- added `g/determinant` implementation to functions
  ([#171](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/171))

- Moved all `literal-function` machinery and definitions to
  `sicmutils.abstract.function`
  ([#171](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/171)).
  `sicmutils.function` now contains only the generic method implementations for
  clojure functions and multimethods.

- Switched inheritance order for functions;
  `:sicmutils.abstract.function/function` (used to be
  `:sicmutils.function/function`) now inherits from `::v/function` instead of
  the other way around.
  ([#171](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/171))

### Literals

- `literal-matrix` fn generates a symbolic matrix
  (https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/169)
- `literal`, `literal-up` and `literal-down` generate symbolic structures
  (https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/169)

### Numeric Tower Adjustments

This release (courtesy of
[#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168)) brings
the numeric tower in line with the scmutils tower. Prior to this release, all
numbers, including complex, descended from `::x/numerical-expression`. Symbolic
expressions _also_ derived from this type! The problem this causes is that all
of generic implementations for the number types default to the symbolic
functions.

If I don't specify a `g/sec` method for numbers, for example, then `(g/sec 12)`
returns a symbolic `(/ 1 (cos 12))`, instead of actually evaluating the
expression.

The fix comes from these changes:

- `::v/number` now means, "the numeric tower ascending from integer -> rational
  -> real -> complex numbers. All of these types now respond `true` to
  `v/number?` (prior to this release, Complex numbers did NOT!)

- `::v/real` now means, "anything in the numeric tower except Complex". These
  all respond true to `v/real?`

- `::x/numeric-expression` has changed to `::x/numeric`, and now means "anything
  that responds to `::"v/number`, plus symbolic expressions, which now clearly
  _represent_ any number in the numeric tower. Query for these with `v/scalar?`

I can now make some comments that clear up my former misunderstandings:

- The `sicmutils.abstract.number` (I'll call this `an` here) namespace is
  responsible for installing generic implementations of all numeric methods for
  symbolic expressions and "literal numbers".

- the `an/literal-number` constructor promotes a number, symbol or symbolic
  expression up to `:xx/numeric`, which means that any operation you perform on
  it will pass it through the symbolic expressions defined in
  `sicmutils.numsymb`. A few notes on these expressions:

  - They will try to preserve exactness, but if they can't - ie, if you do
    something like `(cos (an/literal-number 2.2))` - the system will return
    `-.588`. If you call `(cos (an/literal-number 2))`, you'll get the
    expression `(cos 2)`, preserving exactness.

  - Symbols are automatically interpreted as "literal numbers".

  - The only ways to make a proper symbolic expression that works with the
    generics are:

    - Use the explicit `an/literal-number` constructor
    - pass a symbol to any generic arithmetic function
    - perform any unary or binary arithmetic operation on an existing symbolic
      expression.

  - `an/abstract-number?` returns true for symbolic expressions, anything
    wrapped in `literal-number` or symbols.

  - `literal-number?` only returns true for explicitly wrapped things and
    symbolic expressions, not symbols.

  - use `v/real?`, `v/number?` and `v/scalar?` to query the numeric tower.


- If you want to compare literal numbers and an expression like
  `(an/literal-number 12)`, use `v/eq`. In Clojurescript, this will work with
  the built in `=` as well, since equality is implemented with a protocol that
  we can extend. For example:

```clojure
(v/eq 12 (literal-number 12))
;;=> true

(= 12 (literal-number 12))
;; true in cljs, false in clj
```

If you keep the literal on the left side of `=`, this will work in both systems,
since we've overridden the `=` implementation for literals:

```clojure
(= (literal-number 12) 12)
;;=> true in both languages
```

This paves the way for the other abstract types that exist in `scmutils`, like
matrices, up and down tuples.

### New Generic Functions

This release brings us closer to the interface provided by `scmutils`.

PR https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/169 brings:

- `g/exp2`, `g/exp10` for exponents with base 2 and 10
- `g/log2`, for base 2 logarithms
- `g/log10` for base 10 logs
- `g/gcd` and `g/lcm` are now exposed in `sicmutils.env`

We now expose the following additional trigonometric functions in
`sicmutils.generic` (courtesy of
https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/154):

- `cosh`: hyperbolic cosine
- `sinh`: hyperbolic sine
- `tanh`: hyperbolic tangent, ie sinh/cosh
- `sech`: hyperbolic secant, ie 1/cosh
- `csch`: hyperbolic secant, ie 1/sinh
- `acosh`: inverse hyperbolic cosine, ie, `(= x (cosh (acosh x)))`
- `asinh`: inverse hyperbolic sine, ie, `(= x (sinh (asinh x)))`
- `atanh`: inverse hyperbolic tangent, ie, `(= x (tanh (atanh x)))`

These three methods existed in `sicmutils.env`, but not as extensible generics.
Now they're fully extensible:

- `cot`: cotangent, ie 1/tan
- `sec`: secant, ie 1/cos
- `csc`: cosecant, ie 1/sin

These all work with:

- real and complex numbers
- power series (missing a few implementations, operators and matrices are
  missing the same ones for this reason)
- matrices (square matrices return their power series expansions)
- operators (power series expansion of the operator)
- functions (where they create composition)
- symbolic expressions
- Derivatives and dual numbers! The new functions all work with `D`, the
  forward-mode automatic differentiation operator.

Additionally, four methods that lived in `sicmutils.generic` are now exposed as
generics:

- `real-part`
- `imag-part`
- `angle`
- `conjugate`

These now work on:

- _all_ numeric types, including symbolic expressions.
- functions
- structures (only `magnitude` and `conjugate`)
  - `magnitude` formerly didn't handle structures containing complex numbers by
    taking a proper inner product. This is fixed as of
    [#168](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/pull/168)

## 0.13.0

The main announcement for this release is _Clojurescript Support!_. Implementing
this resulted in a few upgrades along the way:

- more powerful numerics, specifically `definite-integral` and native
  minimization routines
- a generic numeric tower for Clojurescript
- Many more tests! The test coverage was great before, and it's stayed high as
  we've added new implementations.
- added explicit code coverage metrics via Codecov: [![Codecov branch](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/master.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://codecov.io/github/littleredcomputer/sicmutils)

Here are more explicit details on the release.

### Misc

`generic.cljc` now includes a default implementation of:

- `expt` given a valid `mul`
- default `sub`, given a valid `add` and `negate`
- default `div`, given a valid `mul` and `invert`
- `Expression` and `Operator` both have better `print-method` implementations,
  so the repl experience feels more like `scmutils`
- `Operator` now has an `expn` method, which acts like `g/exp` on an operator
  but expands each term in order `n`.
- many, many more tests!

### Clojurescript Support

Full conversion of SICMUtils to Clojurescript. All functionality from v0.12.1
now works in both Clojure and Clojurescript!

Most of the conversion was straightforward. The major missing piece was a
numeric tower implementation for Clojurescript (complex numbers, ratios) that
bring it up to parity with Clojure:

- Add the `bigfraction` implementation from
  [fraction.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fraction.js) sicmutils.ratio for
  cross-platform ratio support (#99)
- Adds CLJS complex number support through [complex.js](https://github.com/infusion/Complex.js) (#41)
- `js/BigInt`, `goog.math.Long` and `goog.math.Integer` implementations round
  out the numeric tower (#45)

### Numerical Routines

The numerical routines in SICMUtils depend heavily on Apache Commons, which of
course only exists in Java. We had to implement much of the numerics code in
native Clojure. It's fast, efficient and functional. Give it a read if you're
curious about how these algorithms work.

- New, native minimization routines have replaced the Apache Commons implementations:

  - **Univariate Minimizers**
    - Port scipy's auto-bracketing + scmutils version (#104)
    - Port golden section search from scipy (#105)
    - Implement Brent's method for fn minimization in native clj (#106)

  - **Multivariate**
    - pure Clojure implementation of Nelder-Mead (#102)

- Native `definite-integral` numerics implementation, written as a series of
  computational essays:

  - **Basics**:
    - [Riemann Sums](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/riemann.cljc), all the way up through efficient, incremental, "accelerated" versions of these easy-to-understand methods:
    - [Midpoint method](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/midpoint.cljc), same development but shorter since it reuses functional abstractions. Also incremental, efficient, accelerated
    - [Trapezoid Method](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/trapezoid.cljc), same idea but for closed intervals.

  - **Sequence Acceleration / Extrapolation Methods**
    - [Polynomial interpolation](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/interpolate/polynomial.cljc): the general thing that "richardson extrapolation" is doing below. Historically cool and used to accelerate arbitrary integration sequences
    - [Rational Function extrapolation](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/interpolate/rational.cljc): used in bulirsch-stoer integration and ODE solving.
    - "[Richardson extrapolation](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/interpolate/richardson.cljc)" is a special case, where we get more efficient by assuming that the x values for the polynomial interpolation go 1, 1/2, 1/4... and that we're extrapolating to 0.

  - **Higher-order Calculus:**
    - [Numerical derivatives](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/derivative.cljc): derivatives using three kinds of central difference formulas... accelerated using Richardson extrapolation, with a nice technique for guarding against underflow.
    - [Simpson's Method](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/simpson.cljc)... fit a parabola to every slice. OR, "accelerate" the trapezoid method with one step of Richarsdson extrapolation!
    - [Simpson's 3/8 Method](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/simpson38.cljc): Same idea, but accelerate a sequence that triples its slices every iteration.
    - [Boole's Rule](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/boole.cljc): trapezoid method plus two steps of Richardson extrapolation. (Are you starting to see the pattern??)
    - [Romberg Integration](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/romberg.cljc): midpoint OR trapezoid, with as many steps of Richardson extrapolation as we can take!
    - [Milne's Rule](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/milne.cljc), MIDPOINT method, one step of extrapolation!
    - [Bulirsch-Stoer integration](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/bulirsch_stoer.cljc)... midpoint or trapezoid, with rational function extrapolation, as many steps as we can handle AND some custom step sizes.

  - **Combinators**:
    - [Variable Substitutions](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/substitute.cljc): implemented as functional wrappers that take an integrator and return a modified integrator.
    - [Improper Integrals](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/infinite.cljc): a template for a combinator that enables infinite endpoints on any integrator, using variable substitution on an appropriate, tunable range.
    - [Adaptive Integration](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature/adaptive.cljc): a combinator that turns any of the integrators above into an "adaptive" integrator that's able to focus in on difficult regions.
  - And finally, "[Numerical Quadrature](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/sicmutils/numerical/quadrature.cljc)", the namespace/essay that ties it all together.

- `sicmutils.numerical.compile` uses [SCI](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), the
  Small Clojure Interpreter, to generate compiled numerical code (#133)

- Implemented ODE solving using @littleredcomputer's
  [odex-js](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/odex-js) library (#135)

### Reader Literals

[data_readers.cljc](https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils/blob/master/src/data_readers.cljc)
provides 3 new data reader literals:

- `#sicm/ratio`

Use this with a ratio literal, like `#sicm/ratio 1/2`, or with a string like
`#sicm/ratio "1/4"`. If the denominator is `1` this literal will return a
`js/BigInt` in Clojurescript, or a Long in Clojure.

- `#sicm/bigint`

Use with a number literal, like, `#sicm/bigint 10`, or a string like
`#sicm/bigint "10000012"` to generate a `js/BigInt` in Clojurescript, or a
`clojure.lang.BigInt` in Clojure.

- `#sicm/complex`

Currently this only works with a string like `#sicm/complex "1 + 2i"`. In the
future it might work with a pair of `(real, complex)`, like:

    #sicm/complex [1 2]

### Power Serious, Power Serious

The Power Series implementation in `series.cljc` received an overhaul. The
implementation now follows Doug McIlroy's beautiful paper, ["Power Series, Power
Serious"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.3156&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
Doug also has a 10-line version in Haskell on [his
website](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/powser.html).

The API now offers two types:

 - `Series`, which represents a generic infinite series of arbitrary values, and
 - `PowerSeries`, a series that represents a power series in a single
   variable; in other words, a series where the nth entry is interpreted as
   the coefficient of $x^n$:

    $$[a b c d ...] == $a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ...$$

`series/series?` responds true to both. `series/power-series?` only responds
true to a `PowerSeries`.

To turn a `PowerSeries` into a `Series`, call it as a function with a single
argument, or pass the series and one argument to `series/value` to evaluate the
series using the above equation.

To turn a `Series` into a `PowerSeries`, call `series/->function`. None of the
functions discussed below can mix series types; you'll have to do the conversion
explicitly.

Each type supports the following generic operations:

- `*`, `+`, `-`, `/` between series and non-series
- `g/negate`, `g/invert`, `g/sqrt`, `g/expt` work as expected.
- `g/add` between series and non-series

`PowerSeries` additionally supports:

- `g/exp`, `g/cos`, `g/sin`, `g/asin`, `g/tan`
- `g/partial-derivative`, so `PowerSeries` works well with `D`

Each of these acts as function composition for the single variable function that
the `PowerSeries` represents. If `s` is a `PowerSeries` that applies as `(s x)`,
`(g/exp s)` returns a series that represents `(g/exp (s x))`.

There are many more new methods (see the namespace for full documentation):

- `starting-with` renamed to `series`
- `power-series`, analogous `series` but generates a `PowerSeries`
- `series*` and `power-series*` let you pass an explicit sequence
- `series/take` removed in favor of `clojure.core/take`, since both series
  objects act as sequences
- `generate` takes an additional optional argument to distinguish between series
  and power series
- `Series` now implements more of `v/Value`
- new `zero`, `one`, `identity` constants
- `constant` returns a constant power series
- `xpow` generates a series representing a bare power of `x`
- `->function` turns a `Series` into a `PowerSeries`
- `value`, `fmap` now handles both `Series` and `PowerSeries`
- `(inflate s n)` expands each term $x^i$ of `s` to $x^{in}$
- `compose` returns the functional composition of two `PowerSeries`
- `revert` returns the functional inverse of two `PowerSeries`
- `integral` returns a series representing the definite integral of the supplied
  `PowerSeries`, 0 => infinity (optionally takes an integration constant)

The namespace also provides many built-in `PowerSeries` instances:

- `exp-series`
- `sin-series`
- `cos-series`
- `tan-series`
- `sec-series`
- `asin-series`
- `acos-series`
- `atan-series`
- `acot-series`
- `sinh-series`
- `cosh-series`
- `tanh-series`
- `asinh-series`
- `atanh-series`
- `log1+x-series`
- `log1-x-series`
- `binomial-series`

And two `Series` (non-power):

- `fib-series`, the fibonacci sequence
- `catalan-series`, the [Catalan
  numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)

### Matrix Generic Operations

`::matrix` gained implementations for `exp`, `cos`, `sin`, `asin`, `tan`,
`acos`, `asin`; these now return taylor series expansions of the operator, where
multiplication is composition as before.

### Operator Generics

`Operator` gained implementations for `cos`, `sin`, `asin`, `tan`, `acos`,
`asin`; these now return taylor series expansions of the operator, where
multiplication is composition as before.

## [v0.21.1]

- Getting Github releases up to parity with the most recent release to Clojars.

## [v0.10.0]

- Did some refactoring and one breaking rename (Struct became Structure, since
  we don't abbreviate other deftypes). This also marks the point of departure
  for working with Functional Differential Geometry.


## [v0.9.8]

- This is the version that was current as of the talk @littleredcomputer gave at
  [Clojure/west 2017](2017.clojurewest.org), entitled "[Physics in
  Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PoajCqNKpg)."
